 Loan Model Report
In this exercise, we were asked to make a predictive model to determine if a loan is healthy or high risk based on a variety of parameters. The factors are loan size, interest rate, borrower income, debt to income,  number of accounts, derogatory marks, and total debt. The model produced the following results:
Healthy Loans
Precision: 1.0 (Accuracy .92)
Recall: .99 (Accuracy .97)
F1 Score: 1.0 (Accuracy .94)
Support: 18765
High Risk Loans
Precision: .84 (Accuracy .99)
Recall: .94 (Accuracy .99)
F1 Score: .89 (Accuracy .99)
Support 619


The results over all support that this is a strong model for predicting which loans are high risk. While the model is better at predicting low risk loans than high risk ones, all scores are near .9. Therefore, I would recommend the company to use this model/
sorry -forgot to put this in the original - it was already done in a sepate doc
